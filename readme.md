# Advent Of Code Solutions

I've been meaning to try this for years.

I started in 2018, but quickly ran into crunch time at work, so I probably
won't get far at all.

Still - I had a few pieces, so I figured I should toss them into a repository.

One of my hopes is to use a bunch of different languages for this, because
there are a number I'd like to at least try at some point which I haven't.

Given that it's a programming game, this is almost irrelevant, but the work in
